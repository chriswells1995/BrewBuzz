# BrewBuzz - If it's beer, it's here

The BrewBuzz team is comprised of two guys who love beer. As we all know, it can be hard to make critical decisions after knocking back a few, and that's where BrewBuzz comes in! BrewBuzz is an application that will let you search, review, and locate your local breweries (so you can call an Uber). Once you have enjoyed your chosen establishment's delicious nectar, you can write a review and help spread the word!

## Getting_Started

Search for your brewery of choice by name or location. Click the corresponding brewery name, and you're on your way to that sweet, sweet yellow gold. If you're having trouble deciding which brewery to go to, read reviews to help narrow your search, or do like we would do and just go to both.
